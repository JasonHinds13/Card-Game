## Card Game

At the moment this is just a dueling mechanic for a game I want to create. Using cards to fight your opponents.

# Todo List
* Apply effect of cards (Function in Game class?)
* Apply effects of defence cards (How will they impact damage?)
* Should cards have a minimum and maximum effect ?
* Handle player applying heal, assist and defence cards to self (Same apply function)
* Implement cards affecting players in multiple turns
