# Card Game

At the moment this is just a dueling mechanic for a game I want to create. Using cards to fight your opponents.

## Todo List
* Apply effects of defence cards (How will they impact damage?)
* Should cards have a minimum and maximum effect ?

## Bugs
* Healing Card won't work for full 3 turns
* Assist cards don't seem to take effect
